Schematics
==========

The schematics in this folder are created with Fritzing. For some reason, the autorouting doesn't pick up all connections made on the breadboard view. Possibly due to errors in the parts definitions, I have no idea.

Will update with proper schematics and board files later. For now it's sufficient to document my breadboard layout so this thing can be duplicated.

The final version may not even use a Moteino, but straight Atmel Agmega328P chips with the supporting passive parts and a RFM69 breakout boards from eBay of AliExpress.
